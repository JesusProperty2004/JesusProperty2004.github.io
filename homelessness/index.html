      Don't you feel loved and cared for? If you do, keep reading.<br><br>
      This world had come into a wicked place, crimes, thives, serial killers. Doen't this feel like a bad thing? Well there is something<br>
      that might be worse!<br>
      
      ...Homelessness...<br>
      
      Homelessness has been around for centries, it started to begin to be a huge problem around the 1600's. <br>
      WOW! That's a long time!<br><br>
      
      <span style="color: Red">Facts</span><br>
      Why is it still universal?<br>
      It is universal because people don’t do anything to help.<br>
      The government doesn't seem to care. It’s like the government is yelling in our face<br>
      “They don't have money, so why should we help them?”<br>
      Because they're people, humans, living creatures.<br><br>
      
      This problem isn't just adluts and teens, it children too!<br>
      
      Did you know  24% in the world make it a city-wide crime to beg in public;<br>
      33% in the world make it illegal to stand around in anyplace in the city;<br>
      18% in the world make it a crime to sleep anywhere in public;<br>
      43% in the world make it illegal to sleep in your car;<br>
      and 53% in the world make it illegal to sit or lay down in particular public places.<br>
      It's just like segregation. I believe they should be able to do the things we can, no matter how much money they have.<br>
      Maybe they look a little worn, but guess what? They’re regular people, in regular bodies.<br>
      I learned everyone needs to respect the people who are homeless.
