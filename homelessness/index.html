      This world had come into a wicked place, crimes, thives, serial killers. Doen't this feel like a bad thing?<br>
      Well there is something that might be worse!<br>
      
      ...Homelessness...<br>
      
      Homelessness has been around for centries, it started to begin to be a huge problem around the 1600's. <br>
      <span style="color: Red">WOW!</span> That's a long time!<br><br>
      
      <span style="color: White; font-size: 40;">Facts</span><br>
      Why is it still universal? <img src="Universal.png"><br>
      It is universal because people don’t do anything to help.<br>
      The government doesn't seem to care. It’s like the government is yelling in our face<br>
      “They don't have money, so why should we help them?”<img src="Yelling in our faces.png"><br>
      Because they're people, humans, living creatures.<br><br>
      
      This problem isn't just adults and teens, it children too!<img src="Children too!.png"><br>
      
      Did you know  24% in the world make it a city-wide crime to beg in public;<br>
      33% in the world make it illegal to stand around in anyplace in the city;<br>
      18% in the world make it a crime to sleep anywhere in public;<br>
      43% in the world make it illegal to sleep in your car;<br>
      and 53% in the world make it illegal to sit or lay down in particular public places.<br>
      It's just like segregation. I believe they should be able to do the things we can, no matter how much money they have.<img src="Money.png"><br>
      Maybe they look a little worn, but guess what? They’re regular people, in regular bodies.<br>
      I learned everyone needs to respect the people who are homeless.<img src="Kind to homeless.png"><br><br>
      
      I reseached poverty.<br>
      Poverty is general state of being scarce,<br>
      death, or the state of one who lacks a certain amount of needs or money.<br>
      This includes social and political elements. Poverty may be defined as<br>
      either not qualified or relative.<br><br>
      
      Did you know 21,000 children die every day around the world.<br> That is equivalent to: 1 child dying every 4 seconds and<br>
      14 children dying every minute! 42% of children in homeless families are under age six.<br>
      Families experiencing homelessness are under a lot of stress. 84% of families experiencing homelessness are female.<br>
      In 2005, roughly 100 million people worldwide were homeless.<img src="Homelessness.png"><br><br>
      
      	Did you know veterans get homeless as well they don’t get to see their family anymore! Why are there so many<br>
      	veterans who are homeless? That’s what I was wondering as well. Well it’s because, a lot of the veterans get<br>
      	physically and/or mentally hurt. People who get out of the military sometimes can’t care for themselves anymore, so they<br>
      	become homeless. People can turn to crime for being homeless.<img src="Homelessness arrest.png"> Imagine this, you are homeless, tired and hungry.<br>
      	Then cops surround you because of that!<span style="color: Red"> WHAT! </span>The most common to get arrested are kids or teens. Also, men are<br>
      	more often homeless than women. This is how serious it is, veterans, kids, teens, people of all different shapes and sizes can be homeless. You can get arrested<br> 
      	for being homeless, and go to jail.<br>
      	Hmmm...which ones worse, in jail or being homeless?<br><br>
      	
      	I found the statistics for what triggers homelessness, 35% lost their job, 15% couldn’t pay the bills, 24% got<br>
      	abused; 11% went to jail 10% are handicap, 10% are heartbroken, 9% drank. Wow! Thats a lot of reasons. Our own little world doesn’t<br>
      	seem so small anymore, huh?<img src="Little world.png"><br><br><br><br>
