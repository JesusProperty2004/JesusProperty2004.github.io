      <span style="font-size: 36">Don't you feel loved and cared for? (If you do, keep reading.)</span><br><br>
      This world had come into a wicked place, crimes, thives, serial killers. Doen't this feel like a bad thing?<br>
      Well there is something that might be worse!<br>
      
      ...Homelessness...<br>
      
      Homelessness has been around for centries, it started to begin to be a huge problem around the 1600's. <br>
      WOW! That's a long time!<br><br>
      
      <span style="color: White, font-size: 24">Facts</span><br>
      Why is it still universal?<br>
      It is universal because people don’t do anything to help.<br>
      The government doesn't seem to care. It’s like the government is yelling in our face<br>
      “They don't have money, so why should we help them?”<br>
      Because they're people, humans, living creatures.<br><br>
      
      This problem isn't just adults and teens, it children too!<br>
      
      Did you know  24% in the world make it a city-wide crime to beg in public;<br>
      33% in the world make it illegal to stand around in anyplace in the city;<br>
      18% in the world make it a crime to sleep anywhere in public;<br>
      43% in the world make it illegal to sleep in your car;<br>
      and 53% in the world make it illegal to sit or lay down in particular public places.<br>
      It's just like segregation. I believe they should be able to do the things we can, no matter how much money they have.<br>
      Maybe they look a little worn, but guess what? They’re regular people, in regular bodies.<br>
      I learned everyone needs to respect the people who are homeless.<br><br>
      
      I reseached poverty.<br>
      Poverty is general state of being scarce,<br>
      death, or the state of one who lacks a certain amount of needs or money.<br>
      This includes social and political elements. Poverty may be defined as<br>
      either not qualified or relative.<br><br>
      
      Did you know 21,000 children die every day around the world.<br> That is equivalent to: 1 child dying every 4 seconds and<br>
      14 children dying every minute! 42% of children in homeless families are under age six.<br>
      Families experiencing homelessness are under a lot of stress. 84% of families experiencing homelessness are female.<br>
      In 2005, roughly 100 million people worldwide were homeless.<br><br>
      
      	Did you know veterans get homeless as well they don’t get to see their family anymore! Why are there so many<br>
      	veterans who are homeless? That’s what I was wondering as well. Well it’s because, a lot of the veterans get<br>
      	physically and/or mentally hurt. People who get out of the military sometimes can’t care for themselves anymore, so they<br>
      	become homeless. People can turn to crime for being homeless. Imagine this, you are homeless, tired and hungry. Then cops surround<br>
      	you because of that! WHAT! The most common to get arrested are kids or teens. Also, men are more often homeless than women. This is how serious<br>
      	it is, veterans, kids, teens, people of all different shapes and sizes can be homeless. You can get arrested, what has this world come to!<br> 
	I found the statistics for what triggers homelessness, 35% lost their job, 15% couldn’t pay the bills, 24% got abused, 11% went to jail 10%<br>
	are handicap, 10% are heartbroken, 9% drank. Wow! Thats a lot of reasons. Our own little world doesn’t seem so small anymore, huh?<br>
