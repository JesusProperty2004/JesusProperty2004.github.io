In the beginning there was God. That's it...God. God wanted something more in life. God spoke into the darkness, "Let there be light!" Then there was light, He called that day. Now there was "day" and "night."<br>
The second day God created the world we live in. He then seperated the Earth and the heavens.<br>
The third day God seperated the dry land to the water. After he created the flowers and plants.<br>
The next day God wanted the world to be more pretty to look at. He created the sun to make the day bright, and He made the moon and stars to twinkle the the night.<br>
The fifth day he made the sea creature, whales, fish, seahorses, etc.<br> 
The sixth day he made the land animals, birds, frog, bugs, etc. He loved his creations, but there was still something missing. Mankind. He named him Adam<br>
On the seventh day he looked around and He said "This is good." Then he rested.
