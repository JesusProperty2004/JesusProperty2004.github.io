  Adam and Eve had 2 sons Cain and Abel. Cain was a farmer and Abel was a shepherd. 
  One day Cain brought, as an offering to Jehovah, some fruit and grain that he had 
  grown. Abel, too, brought some of the best animals of his flock and sacrificed their 
  fat pieces to Jehovah. Jehovah was pleased with Abel and his offering, but Cain and his 
  offering did not please him.
