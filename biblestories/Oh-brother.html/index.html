  Adam and Eve had 2 sons Cain and Abel. Cain was a farmer and Abel was a shepherd. 
  One day Cain brought, as an offering to God, some fruit and grain that he had 
  grown. Abel, too, brought some of the best animals of his flock and sacrificed their 
  fat pieces to God. God was pleased with Abel and his offering, but Cain and his 
  offering did not please him.  Cain was mad that God didn't like his offering. Cain 
  grumbled with anger and scowled with turmoil. "Why are you angry and why do you scowl? 
  If you do what is right, your offering will be accepted? But if you do 
  wrong, sin enters like a wild animal at the door and the desire to sin will overcome 
  you."<br>
  Cain said to his brother Abel, "Let us go into the field." And while they were in 
  the field, Cain struck his brother Abel and killed him.<br>
  God asked about Abel, Cain was mad, he didn't want people to think he was supposed to keep track of him.
  When God found out Cain killed his own brother, he told Cain he shall accept his punnishments.
