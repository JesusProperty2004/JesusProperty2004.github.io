    After God made Adam, He wanted a companion for him. He created Eve. Adam and Eve, good right? Well... 
    almost. God told them they can do anything they want EXCEPT eat off they tree in the center. If they 
    did they will die.<br>
    One day Eve was going passed the tree. Saten was in the tree when Eve walked by. When he came out, 
    he had an apple. Saten tempted Eve and said "God doesn't want you to eat any friut off this tree because if you do, you will be like him."
    Eve took a bit of the apple then gave it to Adam. They relised what they did, they felt guilty. They became naked and covered 
    themselfs in leaves. Next they hid. God came out and ask "Where are you." They replied "We are ashamed." God knew what they had done, they sined agaist him.
    Adam blamed it on Eve, and Eve blamed it on Saten.<br>
    God made punishments for them. Instead of having everything they have ever wished for, they would have to work for it. Saten had to crawl on his belly, everywhere he went. 
    Eve had to go though childbirth.<br><br>
    
    See? Sin is a bad thing. If we sin, we break the relashinship with God. No matter how big or little the sin is. There is always that broken relationship!
