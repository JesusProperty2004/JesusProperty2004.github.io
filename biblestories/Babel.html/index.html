    Everyone in the world spoke the same language. They were forgetting God was there to help them. They said to each other 
    "Come, let us build us a city, and a tower whose top will touch the heavens, and thus make a landmark, that we may not 
    be scattered over all the earth."<br>
    When God looked at the city they were building, he said "See, they are one people and all have one language. This is 
    but the beginning, and now nothing which they plan to do will seem too difficult for them. Come, let us go down and 
    confuse their language, that they may not understand one another."<br>
    Then God put certain people in different parts of the world so they would stop building the city. Therefore they 
    named it Babel, which means Confusion, for there God confused the language of all the people on the earth and 
    scattered them over the entire world.
